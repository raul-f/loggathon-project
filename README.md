# loggathon-project
This is a collection of the pages I developed in Loggi's first hackathon.

The first page (loggathon-registration) registers a possible 'Pickup' applicant, taking all their relevant data (Establishment name, ZIP Code, address, contact info etc.), structuring it and sending it to the server as a JSON file. The second page displays the result of the registration (approved or else) to the user, as soon as the data returns from the server.
